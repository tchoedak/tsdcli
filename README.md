TSDCli

## Motivation
Working with data infrastructure and tooling often involves a lot of manual, repeated tasks. This CLI
is designed to save you time.

Some use cases to solve:

### Data Infra
- Sending over a file to an EMR cluster
- Installing a package on an EMR cluster
- Uninstalling a package on an EMR cluster

### Git
- Commit with a message
- Merge master into current branch
- Git push
- Git pull
- Create a new branch off master


### Gitlab
- Download a repo


### Python
- create a virtualenv and install requirements
- install package

### Workflows
- Chain commands together
